# CodingConventions

This project contains the coding convetions for the source code related to the cooperate project. The conventions are stored as checkstyle rules to be easily usable in coding projects.

## Setup
* Install Checkstyle from Eclipse Marketplace

## Credits
The coding conventions are based on the coding convetions of the [SPLevo tool chain](https://github.com/kopl/SPLevo/tree/master/Releng/org.splevo.releng.codeconventions) licensed under EPL 1.0 and initially created by Benjamin Klatt.
